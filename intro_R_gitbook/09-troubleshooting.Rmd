# Troubleshooting

Even advanced users of R run into problems often. Here are some of the most common errors that can often be resolved quickly:

- file is not in the right place, or is incorrectly named
- improperly formatted files
- missing values
- spelling errors
- incorrectly named parameters

For more complex errors, the help documentation of a function is a good place to start. Additionally, the online community of R users is extremely active and helpful. If you've got a question, it's extremely likely it's been asked and answered many times already!
