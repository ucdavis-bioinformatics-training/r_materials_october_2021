# Introduction to the tidyverse

The [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is a collection of packages by the creators of RStudio that share an approach to data science.

The authors model data science like this:

![Data science life cycle](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/571b056757d68e6df81a3e3853f54d3c76ad6efc/32d37/diagrams/data-science.png)

The tidyverse packages replace some of the base R functions with alternatives that are intended to be more user friendly for data scientists who are following this life cycle.

We will only be covering a few of the packages from the tidyverse.

```{r}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)
```

## Defining tidy data

In "tidy" data, every column is a variable, every row is an observation, and every cell contains a single observation. Is the birthweight data frame tidy? Why or why not?

## Pipes: combining tidyverse functions

The tidyverse employs piping to send the output of one function to another function, rather than the nesting used in base r. The "pipe" is written with a greater than symbol sandwiched between two percent signs, like this: `%>%`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
experiment %>%
  filter(low.birthweight == TRUE) %>%
  select(birth.date, length, birthweight, smoker)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
experiment %>%
  filter(low.birthweight == TRUE) %>%
  select(birth.date, length, birthweight, smoker) %>%
  kable(booktabs = TRUE,
        caption = 'Tidyverse filter and select.')
```
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# equivalent to:
experiment[experiment$low.birthweight == TRUE, c("birth.date", "length", "birthweight", "smoker")]
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  experiment[experiment$low.birthweight == TRUE, c("birth.date", "length", "birthweight", "smoker")],
  booktabs = TRUE,
  caption = 'Base R subsetting.'
)
```
## Transforming data

The `separate()` function makes the conversion of the "birth.date" column into "month," "day," and "year" trivial.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
experiment %>%
  filter(low.birthweight == TRUE) %>%
  select(birth.date, length, birthweight, smoker) %>%
  separate(col = birth.date, sep = "[/]", into = c("month", "day", "year"))
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
experiment %>%
  filter(low.birthweight == TRUE) %>%
  select(birth.date, length, birthweight, smoker) %>%
  separate(col = birth.date,
           sep = "[/]",
           into = c("month", "day", "year")) %>%
  kable(booktabs = TRUE,
        caption = 'Tidyverse separate.')
```

The `mutate()` function adds a new column based on data contained in the existing columns.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
experiment %>%
  filter(low.birthweight == TRUE) %>%
  select(birth.date, length, birthweight, smoker) %>%
  mutate(d = birthweight / length)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
experiment %>%
  filter(low.birthweight == TRUE) %>%
  select(birth.date, length, birthweight, smoker) %>%
  mutate(d = birthweight / length) %>%
  kable(booktabs = TRUE,
        caption = 'Tidyverse mutate.')
```

## Summarizing data

The `group_by()` and `summarize()` functions apply a function to a group defined by one or more categorical variables.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
experiment %>%
  group_by(smoker) %>%
  summarize(mean.birthweight = mean(birthweight))
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
experiment %>%
  group_by(smoker) %>%
  summarize(mean.birthweight = mean(birthweight)) %>%
  kable(booktabs = TRUE,
        caption = 'Tidyverse summarize grouped by smoker.')
```
```{r, eval=FALSE}
experiment %>%
  group_by(smoker, low.birthweight) %>%
  summarize(mean.birthweight = mean(birthweight))
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
experiment %>%
  group_by(smoker, low.birthweight) %>%
  summarize(mean.birthweight = mean(birthweight)) %>%
  kable(booktabs = TRUE,
        caption = 'Tidyverse summarize grouped by smoker and birthweight.')
```

To change the order of rows, use `arrange()`. To return one or more specified rows, use `slice()`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
experiment %>%
  group_by(smoker) %>%
  select(smoker, birthweight, length, head.circumference, weeks.gestation) %>%
  slice_max(order_by = birthweight, n = 5)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
experiment %>%
  group_by(smoker) %>%
  select(smoker, birthweight, length, head.circumference, weeks.gestation) %>%
  slice_max(order_by = birthweight, n = 5) %>%
  kable(booktabs = TRUE,
        caption = 'Tidyverse slice, ordered on birthweight.')
```

The `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()` functions rearrange data, decreasing or increasing the number of columns. The use of this will become more evident during visualization.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
experiment %>%
  filter(low.birthweight == TRUE) %>%
  select(smoker, `miR-16`, `miR-21`, `miR-146a`, `miR-182`) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(`miR-16`, `miR-21`, `miR-146a`, `miR-182`),
               names_to = "gene",
               values_to = "expression") 
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
experiment %>%
  filter(low.birthweight == TRUE) %>%
  select(smoker, `miR-16`, `miR-21`, `miR-146a`, `miR-182`) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(`miR-16`, `miR-21`, `miR-146a`, `miR-182`),
               names_to = "gene",
               values_to = "expression") %>%
  kable(booktabs = TRUE,
        caption = 'Tidyverse pivot_longer.') %>%
  scroll_box(height = "500px")
```

## Exercise 4: converting between base R and Tidyverse

Reproduce the table 7.5 or table 7.6 using base R. Use Tidyverse functions to answer the question you addressed in exercise 3.
